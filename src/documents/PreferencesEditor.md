One of the primary functions of the Infusion [Preferences Framework](PreferencesFramework.md) is to allow you to create
a Preferences Editor: a collection of adjusters that users can use to set their interface preferences.

As of Infusion 4.0, the creation of a Preference Framework and UI Options instance have been combined into a single
component, [`fluid.uiOptions`](UserInterfaceOptionsAPI.md).
